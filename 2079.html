            <h2>Prototype Model [5 Marks]</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Prototype Model</strong> is a software development methodology that emphasizes building a working prototype (an early version of the software) to gather user feedback before the final product is developed. The prototype is an initial version of the system with limited functionality but enough features to allow the users to provide feedback.</p>
            <h3>Key Characteristics of the Prototype Model:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Initial Prototype:</strong> A basic, working version of the software is quickly created, focusing on core functionality. The prototype may not have full features or robust performance.</li>
                <li><strong>User Feedback:</strong> After the prototype is developed, it is shown to the user for feedback. This feedback is crucial to refine and improve the system.</li>
                <li><strong>Iterative Process:</strong> The process of developing the prototype, gathering user feedback, and refining the prototype continues in iterations. Each iteration results in a more complete version of the software.</li>
                <li><strong>Evolutionary Design:</strong> With each prototype iteration, the software evolves. The final product is developed after several cycles of prototyping, each incorporating the feedback from the previous iteration.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexible and Adaptive:</strong> The prototype model is adaptable to changing requirements. It helps to clarify ambiguous requirements by visualizing the product early in the development process.</li>
            </ul>

        <section>
            <h2>Characteristics of a Good SRS [5 Marks]</h2>
            <p>A <strong>Software Requirements Specification (SRS)</strong> is a document that describes the software system to be developed. It includes the functional and non-functional requirements, constraints, and the expected behavior of the software.</p>
            <h3>Key Characteristics of a Good SRS:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clear and Unambiguous:</strong> The requirements must be written clearly and unambiguously to avoid confusion. Each requirement should have only one interpretation.</li>
                <li><strong>Complete:</strong> The SRS should cover all aspects of the system, including the functional, non-functional, and performance requirements. It must also outline the system's interactions with other systems, if any.</li>
                <li><strong>Consistent:</strong> The document must be free of contradictions. Different parts of the SRS should not conflict with each other, and all requirements must be in harmony.</li>
                <li><strong>Verifiable:</strong> Every requirement should be testable or measurable to ensure it can be verified during the testing phase. This helps ensure that the system works as expected.</li>
                <li><strong>Traceable:</strong> Each requirement in the SRS must be traceable to its source. This ensures that all requirements can be traced back to business goals or user needs and ensures no critical features are missed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These characteristics ensure that the SRS acts as a reliable foundation for the design, development, and testing phases, leading to the creation of a product that meets the client's needs and expectations.</p>

            <h2>Size Estimation [3 Marks]</h2>
            <p><strong>Size Estimation</strong> refers to the process of determining the size of the software product that needs to be developed, usually expressed in terms of lines of code (LOC), function points, or use cases. Size estimation helps project managers and developers understand the scope of the software, allocate resources efficiently, and estimate the time required for development.</p>
            <p>There are various techniques for size estimation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lines of Code (LOC):</strong> Counting the lines of code to estimate the project size.</li>
                <li><strong>Function Point Analysis:</strong> A more complex method that assesses the softwareâ€™s functionality based on inputs, outputs, user interactions, and file types.</li>
                <li><strong>Use Case Points:</strong> Based on the number and complexity of use cases.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Accurate size estimation is crucial as it directly impacts project timelines, costs, and resource allocation.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Bottom-Up Approach [5 Marks]</h2>
            <p><strong>The Bottom-Up Approach</strong> focuses on developing individual components or modules first, before integrating them into the full system. Once the small units are ready, they are combined to create the complete system.</p>
            <h3>Key Characteristics:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Module Development First:</strong> Develop small, functional components first, test them, and integrate them.</li>
                <li><strong>Integration:</strong> Modules are combined to form the full system.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Allows for adjustments as requirements evolve during development.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Advantages:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Focus on manageable components</li>
                <li>Better incremental changes</li>
                <li>Improved testing and debugging of individual components</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Difficult to define the overall system structure early on</li>
                <li>Potential integration issues</li>
                <li>Hard to ensure all modules fit together seamlessly</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> In a banking app, develop the account management module, transaction processing, and report generation as separate components before integrating them.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Top-Down Approach [5 Marks]</h2>
            <p><strong>The Top-Down Approach</strong> starts by designing the systemâ€™s architecture at a high level, then breaking it down into smaller components as development progresses.</p>
            <h3>Key Characteristics:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Overall Design First:</strong> Define the systemâ€™s structure and relationships before breaking it down into smaller modules.</li>
                <li><strong>Decomposition:</strong> The high-level design is divided into subsystems and modules.</li>
                <li><strong>Structured Approach:</strong> A systematic process that helps to understand and communicate the design from the start.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Advantages:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Clear vision of the overall system</li>
                <li>Easier management of complex systems</li>
                <li>Helps prioritize module development</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The high-level design may be too abstract initially</li>
                <li>Time-consuming at the beginning</li>
                <li>Difficult to accommodate changes once the high-level design is set</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> In the same banking app, design high-level features such as account management, user authentication, and transaction processing first. Then break them down into submodules for detailed development.</p>

            <h2>What is Software Metric? [5 Marks]</h2>
            <p><strong>Software Metric</strong> is a standard of measurement used to assess and evaluate the quality, efficiency, and performance of software development processes. These metrics can be used to measure various aspects of software, such as its size, complexity, performance, and reliability. Software metrics help in understanding how well the software is progressing, identifying areas that need improvement, and ensuring the software meets the required standards.</p>
            <h3>How Can Software Metrics Be Measured? [5 Marks]</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lines of Code (LOC):</strong> Measures the size of a program by counting the number of lines of code written. However, LOC is not a perfect measure of software quality as it doesn't consider the complexity of the code.</li>
                <li><strong>Function Points:</strong> Measures the functionality delivered by the system from a userâ€™s perspective. It is independent of the technology used and is based on the functionality the system provides.</li>
                <li><strong>Cyclomatic Complexity:</strong> Measures the complexity of the software based on the number of independent paths through the code. It helps in assessing how easy it will be to test and maintain the software.</li>
                <li><strong>Defect Density:</strong> Measures the number of defects found per unit size (e.g., per thousand lines of code). It helps identify how well the software is performing and if quality improvements are needed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Using these metrics, developers and managers can evaluate the performance of the software and improve areas like reliability, efficiency, and maintainability.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Defect Density [5 Marks]</h2>
            <p><strong>Defect Density</strong> is a metric used to assess the quality of the software by measuring the number of defects (bugs or issues) found per unit of size, typically per thousand lines of code (KLOC). It provides insights into how many defects are present in the software relative to its size and helps in identifying the areas of the code that need improvement.</p>
            <h3>How is Defect Density Measured? [5 Marks]</h3>
            <p>The formula for measuring defect density is:</p>
            <p><strong>Defect Density = Number of Defects / Size of the Software (in KLOC)</strong></p>
            <p>For example, if a software application has 200 defects and the size of the code is 50,000 lines of code (50 KLOC), the defect density would be:</p>
            <p><strong>Defect Density = 200 / 50 = 4 defects per KLOC</strong></p>
            <h3>Importance of Defect Density:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Helps in identifying parts of the software that require more testing or refinement.</li>
                <li>Provides insight into the overall quality of the software.</li>
                <li>It can also be used to compare software across different projects or versions.</li>
            </ul>

        <section>
            <h2>Inspection Rate [5 Marks]</h2>
            <p><strong>Inspection Rate</strong> is a software metric used to measure the effectiveness of the inspection process in identifying defects. It evaluates how many defects are found per unit of time or effort spent on reviewing or inspecting the code, documentation, or other software artifacts. It helps in assessing the quality of the inspection process itself.</p>
            <h3>How is Inspection Rate Measured? [5 Marks]</h3>
            <p>The formula for measuring inspection rate is:</p>
            <p><strong>Inspection Rate = Number of Defects Detected / Time Spent on Inspection</strong></p>
            <p>For example, if 100 defects are found in 50 hours of inspection work, the inspection rate would be:</p>
            <p><strong>Inspection Rate = 100 / 50 = 2 defects per hour of inspection</strong></p>
            <h3>Importance of Inspection Rate:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Helps in assessing the efficiency of the inspection process.</li>
                <li>Indicates how effective the review team is in identifying issues within the software.</li>
                <li>Allows for process improvement, by adjusting time or methods used during inspections to increase defect detection.</li>

            <p><strong>White Box Testing</strong> and <strong>Black Box Testing</strong> are two fundamental types of software testing that focus on different aspects of the software and its functionality. Hereâ€™s a detailed comparison between both types of testing:</p>
            
            <h3>1. White Box Testing</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Definition:</strong> White Box Testing is a type of software testing where the tester has full knowledge of the internal workings of the application. The tester evaluates the internal structure, code, and logic of the software.</li>
                <li><strong>Focus:</strong> It focuses on testing the internal paths, logic, structure, and implementation of the code.</li>
                <li><strong>Test Basis:</strong> White Box testing is based on the code and architecture of the software.</li>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Unit testing, Integration testing.</li>
                <li><strong>Advantages:</strong>

            <h2>1. Define DFD for Library Management System (Level-0) [2 Marks]</h2>
            <p><strong>DFD (Data Flow Diagram)</strong> is a graphical representation of the flow of data through a system, showing how data moves from input to output. At Level-0 (Context Diagram), the Library Management System is viewed as a single process where inputs are books, members, and staff, and the output is the management of library operations like issuing and returning books.</p>
            <p><strong>Level 0 DFD</strong>: At this level, we represent the library system as a single process interacting with external entities such as the library member, librarian, and the external database for book details. The flow of data indicates how members borrow books, return them, and get their queries handled by the system.</p>

            <p><strong>Level-1 DFD</strong> expands on the context diagram and provides a more detailed view of the systemâ€™s major processes. It breaks the single process of the library management system into multiple sub-processes, including handling book issuing, book returning, and managing member information.</p>

            <h3>Processes in the Level-1 DFD:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Process 1: Member Management</strong> - Handles the registration of new members and manages member details (e.g., name, contact information).</li>
                <li><strong>Process 2: Book Inventory Management</strong> - Manages book inventory, including adding new books and checking the availability of books in the library.</li>
                <li><strong>Process 3: Book Issuing</strong> - Manages the process of issuing books to members, verifying member details, and checking book availability.</li>
                <li><strong>Process 4: Book Returning</strong> - Handles the return of books, updating the system with the return date, and re-adding the book to the inventory.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>External Entities in Level-1 DFD:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Library Member</strong> - Interacts with the system to borrow and return books.</li>
                <li><strong>Librarian</strong> - Manages the system and handles member queries, adding or removing books, and updating records.</li>
                <li><strong>Book Database</strong> - Stores details of books, including availability and location.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Data Stores in Level-1 DFD:</h3>
