                <h5 class="highlight">Program:</h5>
                <p class="content-text">A program is a sequence of instructions written in a programming language to perform a specific task. It is a single unit of code that typically solves one problem or completes a specific function, like adding two numbers or printing text.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> A program that adds two numbers together.</p>

                <h5 class="highlight">Software:</h5>
                <p class="content-text">Software is a broader term that encompasses a collection of programs, libraries, configuration files, and sometimes documentation. It is not just a single task but a combination of multiple related programs that work together to perform a wide range of functions.</p>
